## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology

### What I learned

In this project I was able to exercise the use of flexbox and css grid, despite being a simple resolution application and that could be done more quickly using some library such as tailwind or bootstrap, I decided to opt for a more "pure" solution using simple css.

The use of absolute/relative positioning for images was also a relevant point, I understand that in the case of the challenge in question, perhaps the final result was not so good, however the intention was to actually train these properties, I believe I did not use them in the right way. more efficient and accept suggestions on how to improve the fit of these images.

To organize the classes I used the BEM methodology, it is easier to understand the code when it is done using pure css, which is the pattern I intend to follow in this type of solution.

### Continued development

There are several improvements that can be implemented in the construction of the current page, for example, improvements in the structure of the classes, in the organization of the HTML and in the solutions regarding the positioning of the images according to the resolution.

In the next projects I want to improve my ability to organize the code, make more efficient use of flexbox and CSS grid.
